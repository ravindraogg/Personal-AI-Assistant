# Personal AI Assistant

This repository contains the **Personal AI Assistant**, an advanced decision-making model designed to categorize and process user queries effectively. It is currently at **10% development** and will evolve into a full-fledged AI assistant.

## Features
- **Query Categorization**: Classifies user queries into general, real-time, or task-based actions.
- **Automation Support**: Opens and closes applications, plays music, sets reminders, and more.
- **Image Generation**: Uses AI to generate images based on text prompts.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Converts text to speech using edge-tts.
- **Web Scraping & Searching**: Retrieves real-time data using BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Google Search API.

The project leverages a diverse stack of technologies for AI, automation, and web interaction:

- **Python-dotenv** – Environment variable management.
- **Groq** – AI model inference.
- **AppOpener** – Application launcher.
- **pyWhatkit** – WhatsApp automation.
- **BeautifulSoup (bs4)** – Web scraping.
- **Pillow** – Image processing.
- **Rich** – Rich text formatting.
- **Requests** – HTTP requests handling.
- **Keyboard** – Keyboard event handling.
- **Cohere** – AI-powered text processing.
- **Googlesearch-python** – Google search automation.
- **Selenium** – Browser automation.
- **Mtranslate** – Language translation.
- **Pygame** – Audio playback.
